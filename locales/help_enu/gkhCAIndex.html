    <h1>Certainty Index</h1>

    <p>
        The Certainty Index is an attribute of data about a person as a special indicator
        that can be evaluated for a <a href="gkhRec_Individual.html">person record</a> only.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each <a href="gkhRec_SrcLink.html">reference to a source</a> in a person record
        has a specific certainty level of mention for that person in the source.
        Certainty level can have the following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unreliable evidence or estimated data (certainty is 25%).</li>
        <li>Questionable reliability of evidence (certainty is 50%).</li>
        <li>Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event (certainty is 75%).</li>
        <li>Direct and primary evidences, or dominance of evidences (certainty is 100%).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        While you are researching and viewing some information, the certainty level shows you how much
        you can trust that information. It is better to set &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot;
        if a source document had blots or was damaged and could not be read with confidence.
        This can prevent you from making false conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a reference to a source has no certainty level specified in the database,
        it is interpreted by the program as "Unreliable evidence or estimated data" when calculating the Certainty Index.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Certainty Index is evaluated automatically for each person based on certainty level (as the weighted arithmetic mean). You can view the Certainty Index
        in a <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module for analysis of mean values
        or in <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">tree diagrams</a> for pictorial presentation.
        The index is evaluated using all references to sources, specified
        in both person record and all materials and events.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the settings dialog "Service\Options", on the "Common" tab,
        there is a separate option "Certainty assessment algorithm", which allows you to change the calculation algorithm.
        Possible options: weighted average, simple average, minimum, maximum.
