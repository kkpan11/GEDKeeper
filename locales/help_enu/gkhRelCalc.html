    <h1>Relationship Calculator</h1>

    <p>
        This calculator is designed to calculate and display possible kinship ties between any two persons
        in the database. To calculate, you need to select the first and second person using the buttons, after which the program
        will immediately calculate the possible kinship option. If necessary, you can swap the persons - accordingly,
        the kinship formulations may change significantly.
    </p>

    <p>
        In some cases, it is impossible to establish an unbroken chain of kinship.
        In such cases, one or more breaks are formed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The mechanism on which this module is built is also used to determine relationships
        in the tree diagram (when the <a href="gkhOptions.html#tree">option to display relationships</a>
        in the tree is enabled).

        This module uses the method of searching for connections along a path in a graph.
        That is, first a complete map of all connections between two persons is built - a graph.
        Then, between them in the graph, a search is performed for the shortest path, which gives a chain of pairs of people.
        Then, the program determines a simple kinship connection between each pair of people.
        In the next step, each of the simple connections is combined with the previous one with an attempt to simplify
        or reduce to a certain term.
