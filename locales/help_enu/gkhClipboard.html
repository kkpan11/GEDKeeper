        Specialized copy and paste functions are available on the `Events` and `Associations` tabs of the personal records editing dialog, the `Events` tab of the family records dialog,
        and on the `Sources` tab of all dialogs that may have links to sources (personal records, family records, multimedia records).
    </p>

    <p>
        The operation of these functions differs from the operation of standard clipboard functions of operating systems - the GEDKeeper program clipboard can simultaneously
        include one record of each type (Event, Association, Source citation).
    </p>

    <p>
        On the keyboard, these functions are available with the same keys as the standard ones: [<kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>] - copy and [<kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd>] - paste.

        These functions are useful in the following case: when processing a large array of information (for example, entering a lot of data from a census),
        many persons need to insert the same information (for example, the fact of residence with the indication of the place and year of the census, as well as,
        a citation to the source - a census, with the same page number for everyone indicated on it). In this case, when the first person is completely filled in,
        it is necessary to copy the residence fact and citation to the source to the clipboard before closing the editing dialog. Then, in each subsequent
        person, simply insert these items. When changing the source page, you can insert a citation, open it for editing, change the page number and copy
        this citation to the clipboard again.
