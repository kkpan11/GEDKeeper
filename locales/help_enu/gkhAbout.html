        GEDKeeper is free software that manages your personal genealogical database. The 'GED' prefix in the product title stands for GEDCOM&mdash;an international
        de facto standard describing how to store and exchange genealogical data which is used by many commercial genealogical products. The only specification
        used by GEDKeeper to store its data is GEDCOM. This extremely advances the GEDKeeper compatibility level with other products.
    </p>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper has very simple and self-explanatory user interface. Any user with any experience will find working with this application is straightforward.
        The target audience of the product is mostly Russian users. This is because GEDKeeper manipulates patronymic names which automatically handles a woman's last name using
        specific features of the Russian language, etc.

        The author's aim was to create an easy-to-use product and not an overladen all-in-one program. The primary goal is to invent a fast and effective tool to
        manage a personal genealogical database. A tool that will become an addition to the traditional card index.
