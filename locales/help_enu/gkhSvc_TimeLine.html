    <h1>Time line</h1>

    <p>
        Time line is a visual tool for database filtering.
        Moving its slider defines a year and the list of persons displayed are only people who
        lived in that year.
    </p>

    <p>
        Time line is useful on data analysis and source processing&mdash;you
        can view only people who lived in an affected year.
        You can combine time line filtering with general person filtering by locations and names.
