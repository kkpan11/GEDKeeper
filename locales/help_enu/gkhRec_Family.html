    <h1>Family record</h1>

    <p>
        The family record is one of the main record types available in a genealogical database.
        Family records store information about a family, conjoints, events, and data from the family&#39;s life and children.
        You can also add text notes, references to sources, and multimedia objects into a family record.

    <p>
        There is a table on the &quot;Families&quot; tab of the main working
        window, where you can find all families stored in the database. Each family
        record has a summary area to the right of the table, where you can view
        the entire information about a family, conjoints, children, events, and where
        you can jump to other records.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: if one of the spouses is not indicated in any way in the family record,
        he is considered unknown (there are specific processing rules for tree diagrams for this);
        if he is indicated as a person with the name N or any other abbreviation,
        this is considered an indication of a specific record.
